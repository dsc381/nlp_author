1. First run "$ python convert.py data/yelp_academic_dataset_review.json"

Currently, get_yelp_id() will return a dict such that:

dict["yelp business id"] -> rest_id class, where each data field is a
list where each entry's index corresponds to the date field's index. So to get the date of the 2nd review, it would be rest_id.rev_dates[2]
